# NYC_CAFRs
Liberating data from NYC's consolidated annual financial report (basically the city's audit)

Two very achievable things we can do to make a dent in the universe here:

1) there's a story here about how local gov's like NYC are paying professional services firms big $$$ on billable hours to have analysts literally copy and paste data out of CAFRs so they can then actually do what the city is paying them to do.

A rough number there would be the amount NYC spent on this could be found by summing up how is spent on banks.  The machine readable, digitally native data alternative means this professional services could be done better, faster, cheaper.

2) build a pilot "Open NYC Audit" with key tables liberated from the PDF CAFR such as the statement of net position, pension liabilities, and OPEB liabilities.  The goal would be provide this key public information so creative data folks can vizualize it and journalists and other civically engaged folks can use this info to educate the public.
